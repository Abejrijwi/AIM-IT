                    Information Technology, Knowledge Resource Center of Maulana Mazharul Haque
                    Arabic & Persian University,Patna and I wish to convey the passion and enthusiasm that
                    both staff and students bring to all that they do here, making this College a wonderful
                    place to learn. This College is renowned for the outstanding holistic education that we
                    provide, since we have a strong focus on student academic progress on monthly basis
                    and achievement. We have a well equipped Library, besides other departmental libraries, with e-learning
                    facilities as well. The College has a Centre for Computer Sciences with Computer Labs; a lot of e-learning
                    material on the internet web-site of the college. and a wifi in the college campus itself.
                    Students are provided an environment where they are stretched and challenged and have their expectations
                    raised to achieve demanding targets, evidenced in the results where our students perform exceptionally well. I
                    am proud of the brilliant body of teaching staff that we have, engaging the students in a wide range of exciting
                    learning opportunities.
                    I believe that all our students are an intricate combination of both strength and ability for improvement.
                    Understanding these elements is the key to discovering and fulfilling their potential and students success
                    cannot be defined by qualification alone. We ensure that students leave the College as dynamic and impactful
                    global citizens, equipped to play a leading role in whichever walk of life they choose. To achieve this, students
                    are encouraged to participate in the extensive array of opportunities which exist beyond the classroom also.
